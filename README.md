## My process

### What I learned

I’ve made significant progress working with my stack! I’ve gained a much deeper understanding of Vitest and have improved my overall use of the frontend stack.
Vitest is still a bit challenging to grasp, but it becomes easier each time I write tests and practice consistently.

### Continued development

I aim to deepen my expertise in testing and enhance my proficiency in writing TypeScript code. Additionally, I plan to complete my frontend stack by gaining a solid understanding of Next.js and integrating it into my existing MERN stack with TypeScript, Vitest, and Framer Motion. From there, I intend to refine and further optimize my skills.
